# Spain-Electricity-Price-Prediction

# Context
In a paper released early 2019, forecasting in energy markets is identified as one of the highest leverage contribution areas of Machine/Deep Learning toward transitioning to a renewable based electrical infrastructure.

# Content
This dataset contains 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. Consumption and generation data was retrieved from ENTSOE a public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO Red Electric España. Weather data was purchased as part of a personal project from the Open Weather API for the 5 largest cities in Spain and made public here.
